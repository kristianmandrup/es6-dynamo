# Silva light

Based on [silva-earth](https://ferdychristant.com/introducing-silva-earth-8787fc404ae6#.hejwx7j6m)

Read the other recent (early 2017) [Web Tech articles](https://ferdychristant.com/tagged/web-development) on the framework for **JungleDragon** and **Silva** to get the general idea.

To get a general idea, read the [jungledragon strategy](https:// ferdychristant.com/jungledragon-strategy-update-99d5f1e7a19f#.xf8ijnay7)

- A new **Design System**

Also see [gist](https://gist.github.com/fchristant) on how to use it...
