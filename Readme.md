Based on [silva-earth](https://ferdychristant.com/introducing-silva-earth-8787fc404ae6#.hejwx7j6m)

Read the other recent (early 2017) [Web Tech articles](https://ferdychristant.com/tagged/web-development) on the framework for *JungleDragon* and *Silva* to get the general idea

## To run

Look at the `gulpfile` and have fun :)

- `gulp scripts` - compile + reload/launch
- `gulp watch` - watch and compile + reload/launch

Project based on his `es6` repo on gitlab with the `.sass` file from one article and the `main.css` from `silva.earth`. Use as you like.
